# Surveys

Use the PostHog MCP tools to help the user with survey management:

1. To list all surveys, use `surveys-get-all`
2. To get details about a specific survey, use `survey-get` with the survey ID
3. To view survey responses and statistics, use `survey-stats`
4. To create a new survey, use `survey-create`
5. To update a survey, use `survey-update`
6. To launch or stop a survey, use the appropriate update action

## Example prompts

- "Show me all my surveys"
- "What are the responses to the NPS survey?"
- "Create a feedback survey for the checkout page"
- "How many people completed the onboarding survey?"
- "Stop the beta feedback survey"
