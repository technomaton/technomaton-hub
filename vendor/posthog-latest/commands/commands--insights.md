# Insights

Use the PostHog MCP tools to help the user with insights and analytics:

1. To list existing insights, use `insights-get-all`
2. To view a specific insight, use `insight-get` with the insight ID
3. To run a custom query, use `insight-query` or `query-run`
4. For natural language questions, use `query-generate-hogql-from-question` to convert to HogQL first
5. To create new insights, use `insight-create-from-query`

## Example prompts

- "Show me my top insights"
- "How many users signed up last week?"
- "What's the conversion rate for the checkout funnel?"
- "Create an insight showing daily active users"
